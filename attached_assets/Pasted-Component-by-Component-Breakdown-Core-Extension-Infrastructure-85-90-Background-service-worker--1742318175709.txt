Progress Analysis:
The ProxyEthica extension has a strong foundation with well-implemented core functionality and user interface components. The extension's basic proxy capabilities work properly, and the UI is polished and user-friendly.
However, when compared to industry leaders like Oxylabs, there are significant gaps in advanced features, API infrastructure, and enterprise capabilities. The server-side infrastructure appears to be in early stages of development based on the existence of apphosting.yaml.
Next Critical Steps:
Complete Firebase integration for robust authentication and data management
Implement location targeting for proxy servers
Build structured session control mechanisms
Develop API infrastructure for programmatic access
Enhance analytics and reporting capabilities
