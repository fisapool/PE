## Project Structure 

# ProxyEthica Firebase Integration

This document outlines the Firebase integration for the ProxyEthica Chrome extension.

## Architecture

The extension uses Firebase for:
- User authentication
- Storing proxy session data
- Tracking bandwidth contributions
- Managing user credits
- Offline support

## Firebase Services Used

- **Authentication**: Email/password authentication
- **Firestore**: NoSQL database for storing user data
- **Analytics**: Optional tracking of usage patterns
- **Hosting**: Hosting the dashboard web app

## Collections Structure

1. **users**: User profiles and credit balances
   - `userId`: (document ID)
   - `email`: User's email
   - `credits`: Available proxy credits
   - `contribution`: Object containing bandwidth contribution stats

2. **apiKeys**: Secure storage of API keys
   - `userId`: (document ID)
   - `key`: The API key
   - `createdAt`: Creation timestamp

3. **proxySessions**: Records of proxy sessions
   - `userId`: User who created the session
   - `ip`: Proxy IP address
   - `country`: Country of the proxy
   - `createdAt`: Start time
   - `active`: Whether session is active

4. **contributions**: Records of bandwidth contributions
   - `userId`: Contributing user
   - `timestamp`: When contribution occurred
   - `bandwidthBytes`: Amount contributed
   - `creditsEarned`: Credits earned

## Security Rules

The Firestore security rules enforce:
- Users can only read/write their own data
- API keys are read-only by the owning user
- Contribution records cannot be modified after creation

## Error Handling

All Firebase operations use try/catch blocks and proper error handling.
The `firebase-error-handler.js` utility provides user-friendly error messages.

## Offline Support

The extension uses Firestore offline persistence to function even when
offline, syncing when connection is restored.

## Integration Points

- **Authentication**: Login/signup in popup.html
- **Profile Management**: Settings page
- **Proxy Usage**: Background script for tracking
- **Bandwidth Contribution**: Background script for recording # PE - Residential Proxy Extension
